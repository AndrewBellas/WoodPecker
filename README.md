<b> What is WoodPecker? </b>

WoodPecker is an esoteric language designed to encourage learning of programming concepts through high-level Pythonic syntax, while allowing users to control several aspects of the language such as type-strength and memory management.

<b> So what is the purpose of WoodPecker? </b>

An excellent question! WoodPecker is a programming language designed to teach programming! Ultimately, it benefits students pedagogically by offering simplistic Pythonic syntax, and the ability to modify how the very language itself operates (E.G. selecting whether the program being written should be strongly or weakly typed), giving educators the ability to use it as a resource for teaching the fundamentals of computer languages.
